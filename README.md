webdriver-runner
================

basically an @Inject WebDriver multi-browser / parallel / cloud-remote (SauceLabs) configurable test runner infra ;)

webdriver-runner is a small micro framework/library which injects the concrete 
driver implementation class used in your write Selenium 2.0 (AKA WebDriver) JUnit Tests.

This avoids hard-coding new FirefoxDriver() etc. within your functional test code,
and enables switching by configuration e.g. from say the FirefoxDriver to the ChromeDriver, 
e.g. simply via a Java system property (-D), without changing test source code.

Likewise, the same test code could easily be made to execute twice, but once on the FirefoxDriver,
and then on the ChromeDriver.  Furthermore, you can configure webdriver-runner to let
the very same clean functional test run in parallel on different WebDriver implementations.

webdriver-runner is split into several artifacts:

* webdriver-runner-core is for local tests execution. 
See WebDriverParametrizedExampleTest (TODO LINK) for a usage example.
* _webdriver-runner-saucelabs (TBD) will allow running tests on https://saucelabs.com_

_TODO: blurb with details re. -D configuration._

_TODO: blurb with details re. parallel test execution TBD._

_TODO: blurb about how to get it from my Maven repo, Ã  la webdriver-reporting._

BTW: You may find webdriver-reporting (TODO LINK) of interest to you as well?
